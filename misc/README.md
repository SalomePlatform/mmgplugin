How to
========

* To run the application, launch the following commands:
>  cd src
>  ./launch.sh
* Select the meshes you want to study and add them to the directory `mesh_data/study_meshes`. You can store meshes in `mesh_data/archive_meshes`
* Select the functions you want to compute in `src/main.py`
